# Final-Project

This program takes in two equally sized one-dimensional arrays of numbers and plots them on a graph. 
To input information correctly, the lists of numbers must start and end with a bracket and be separated by a comma with no spaces inbetween. 
Input x values into the box labeled x values. Same for y values. Once data is input, if no errors have displayed, click the plot button to plot the numbers of the graph. 
At any time, you can select a different color, line shape, or icon shape on the left side. If you have already made a plot, press plot again to see the changes. 
You may rename the title at any time by typing in the corresponding box. 
Example data:
x: [12,43,25,33,68,54]
y: [57,6,22,34,65,13]
At any time, press the clear all button to wipe all inputs made so far.
